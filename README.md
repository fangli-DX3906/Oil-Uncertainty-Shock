# Oil Uncertainty Shock

The identification strategy in this work is motivated Berger et al. (2020), Uhlig (2005) and Furlanetto et al. (2019). 

Given the second order moment news shock to oil price (oil price shock) should increase the future oil price volatility, then after an oil price shock, then in the future of this time, the oil price volatility should increase relative the aggregate marco volatility. Then in the future, the ratio of oil price volatility over aggregate marco volatility should increases. Using this information as the regularized term to maximize the future oil price volatility should identifiy this shock.

I also constrain that the oil price uncertainty shock increases the ratio of realized oil price volatility over the stock market volatility in the future, i.e., the realized volatility ratio positively responds to the oil price uncertainty shock. An expansionary oil price uncertainty shocks both increases oil price volatility and stock market volatility.

### Thanks

I wish to extend my deepest thanks to my advisor for providing generous guidance on this project and the SVAR model's identification and estimation techniques.
